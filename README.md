### Back-End Specifications
<!-- DONE -->

You’ll need to complete the following tasks in each of these back-end files:

* `server.js`: Implement the Apollo Server and apply it to the Express server as middleware.
<!-- DONE -->

* `auth.js`: Update the auth middleware function to work with the GraphQL API.
<!-- DONE -->

	**Hint**: Refer to the class activities as a refresher on how to do this.

* `Schemas` directory:

	* `index.js`: Export your typeDefs and resolvers.
	<!-- DONE -->

	* `resolvers.js`: Define the query and mutation functionality to work with the Mongoose models.
	<!-- DONE -->

		**Hint**: Use the functionality in the `user-controller.js` as a guide.

	* `typeDefs.js`: Define the necessary `Query` and `Mutation` types:

		* `Query` type:

			* `me`: Which returns a `User` type.
		
		* `Mutation` type:

			* `login`: Accepts an email and password as parameters; returns an `Auth` type.

			* `addUser`: Accepts a username, email, and password as parameters; returns an `Auth` type.

			* `saveBook`: Accepts a book author's array, description, title, bookId, image, and link as parameters; returns a `User` type. (Look into creating what's known as an `input` type to handle all of these parameters!)

			* `removeBook`: Accepts a book's `bookId` as a parameter; returns a `User` type.
			
		* `User` type:

			* `_id`

			* `username`

			* `email`

			* `bookCount`

			* `savedBooks` (This will be an array of the `Book` type.)

		* `Book` type:

			* `bookId` (Not the `_id`, but the book's `id` value returned from Google's Book API.)

			* `authors` (An array of strings, as there may be more than one author.)

			* `description`

			* `title`

			* `image`

			* `link`

		* `Auth` type:

			* `token`

			* `user` (References the `User` type.)


### Front-End Specifications

You'll need to create the following front-end files:

<!-- DONE -->
* `queries.js`: This will hold the query `GET_ME`, which will execute the `me` query set up using Apollo Server.


<!-- DONE -->
* `mutations.js`:

	* `LOGIN_USER` will execute the `loginUser` mutation set up using Apollo Server.

	* `ADD_USER` will execute the `addUser` mutation.

	* `SAVE_BOOK` will execute the `saveBook` mutation.

	* `REMOVE_BOOK` will execute the `removeBook` mutation.

Additionally, you’ll need to complete the following tasks in each of these front-end files:

* `App.js`: Create an Apollo Provider to make every request work with the Apollo Server.
	
* `SearchBooks.js`:

	* Use the Apollo `useMutation()` Hook to execute the `SAVE_BOOK` mutation in the `handleSaveBook()` function instead of the `saveBook()` function imported from the `API` file.

	* Make sure you keep the logic for saving the book's ID to state in the `try...catch` block! 

* `SavedBooks.js`:

	* Remove the `useEffect()` Hook that sets the state for `UserData`.

	* Instead, use the `useQuery()` Hook to execute the `GET_ME` query on load and save it to a variable named `userData`.

	* Use the `useMutation()` Hook to execute the `REMOVE_BOOK` mutation in the `handleDeleteBook()` function instead of the `deleteBook()` function that's imported from `API` file. (Make sure you keep the `removeBookId()` function in place!)

* `SignupForm.js`: Replace the `addUser()` functionality imported from the `API` file with the `ADD_USER` mutation functionality.

* `LoginForm.js`: Replace the `loginUser()` functionality imported from the `API` file with the `LOGIN_USER` mutation functionality.
